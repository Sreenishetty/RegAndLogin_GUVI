# Registration And Login 

## Python Login and Register is a module developed to provide basic user authentication in Python It is a very bare-bones structure for the reason that other developers can access the contents of the source files and look around in order to learn how to structure their own modules or projects. 

```The project is to create login and register page. Using text file Handling. Username must be different at every new registration. Username and password must be in a proper format. Even user have an option to change password if user forgot their password. If a new user try to login without registeration than tell them to register firstly.```
